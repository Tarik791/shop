ðŸ“¦ Application Setup Guide
Follow the steps below to build and run the application using Docker:

âœ… 1. Build Docker Containers
bash
docker-compose build
This command builds all the necessary containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

ðŸš€ 2. Start the Application
bash
docker-compose up
This starts all containers and runs the application.

ðŸ›  3. Run Database Migrations
Open a terminal session inside the running container:

bash
docker exec -it shop-app-1 bash
Then run the following command to migrate and reset the database:

bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
After that, you can exit the container with:

bash
exit
ðŸ§ª 4. Generate Dummy Shop Data
Run the following Artisan command from your host machine:

bash
php artisan app:generate-dummy-shop-data --products=100 --variants=2000 --images=200
This will generate 100 products, each with multiple variants and images.

ðŸ§¹ 5. Clear Shop Data (Optional)
If you want to clear all the generated shop data, you can run the following Artisan command:

bash
php artisan app:clear-shop-data
This will delete all the products, variants, and images from the database.

Your application is now ready with sample shop data, or cleared if you ran the cleanup command. âœ…
